                <p>Through this assignment, we learned how to create functional graphic symbols or logos to communicate
                    the intended message based on research. Also, we learned that functional designs are distinctive,
                    appropriate, timeless, practical, and&nbsp;simple.</p>

                    <h3> Exploring Designs</h3>
                    <p>Nijiya Market is known for a Japanese supermarket that provides fresh and organic food. Even
                        though I often go there, when I tried to remember the Nijiya logo, the color scheme immediately
                        came to mind, and however, I couldn't remember the design. In this project, I tried to create a
                        design that is easy for everyone to remember and&nbsp;recognizable.</p>

                    <h3>Proposal Designs</h3>
                    <p>Nijiya uses ladybugs to pest control instead of using agriculture chemicals for their fields. I
                        wanted to create a memorable and friendly-looking icon for Nijiya, and I decided to choose
                        ladybugs for the first idea. My second idea was the ear of rice. I tried to create a delicate
                        design to express like the atmosphere of Japan's idyllic rural&nbsp;scenery.</p>

                    <h3>Final Logo Design</h3>
                    <p>The third idea was shiitake mushrooms. When I went grocery shopping at Nijiya, I was surprised
                        that there were organic and inorganic shiitake mushrooms. I thought shiitake mushroom was made
                        in a specific environment using bacterias, and they grew by organic farming. I liked the curved
                        shape of shiitake mushrooms, and I thought it is memorable and&nbsp;recognizable.</p>

                    <h3>My Challenge</h3>
                    <p>It was difficult for me to create an expected design with perfect curves without using outline
                        strokes. The first design I submitted was using outline strokes. However, I wanted to further my
                        design skill, and I kept seeking more polished design. Finally, I found appropriate curves for
                        the Nijiya&nbsp;logo.</p>

                <p>Palovina is a face and skincare line using high-quality olive oil from
                    Palestine. I used Palestinian inspired type, imagery, and shapes to express the brandâ€™s origins to
                    its largely female&nbsp;audience.</p>

                    <h3>Branding</h3>
                    <p>In this branding project, I built a brand strategy based on detailed research, and I created a
                        logo, packagings, and a website. I tried to create an elegant design that matches high-quality
                        products, and I also considered eco-friendly and designs for the&nbsp;environment.</p>

                    <h3>Sketching based on researches</h3>
                    <p>The first thing I noticed when I started researching was the Arabic pattern. The arabesque
                        represents the universality, or god, which repeats geometric patterns and expands infinitely. I
                        was also fascinated by its beauty and started by making my original Arabic&nbsp;patterns.</p>

                    <h3>Prototypes</h3>
                    <p>Next, I thought about the package design using my pattern. I wanted to create a new design by
                        using the two squares that are the basis of my pattern, and I thoroughly investigated the design
                        of the polygonal boxes. As a result, I decided to make a box in which squares were tilted 45
                        degrees and overlapped. At first glance, it seemed simple, and it seemed like it could be done
                        soon. However, I failed over ten times by tiled and error several small things interacted with
                        each other, such as the size of the box, the thickness of the paper, and paper&nbsp;material.

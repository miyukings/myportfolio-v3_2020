                    <p>In this project, I drew more than 100 sketches for each topic and created three designs based on
                        these sketches. I chose Colors, Time, and Choice for this project. Once the design direction was
                        selected, I had created the remaining two designs, which were cohesive and&nbsp;polished.</p>

                    <h3>Colors</h3>
                    <p>As for colors, I thought that we are not able to know the actual colors of things, and we can see
                        the colors only within the human color range. In that case, we do not know that strawberry’s
                        color is red or not. I thought about which color is the best color to suppress appetite and the
                        most unexpecting color and, I decided to use blue for the color. Also, I wanted to use different
                        materials for each design, and I used felt sheets made of recycled plastic bottles, watercolor
                        paintings, and&nbsp;gouache.</p>

                    <h3>Time</h3>
                    <p>The second topic was time, and I tried to represent the passage of time using the melted ice
                        cream. At the first book design, I used was strawberries, and I wanted to create a pop design
                        similar to the first design. It was hard to choose the background and text color to match the
                        ice cream’s color, and I spent a lot of time selecting the functional color as a part of
                        the&nbsp;trilogy. </p>

                        one from several selections. I represented many choices using a bunch of keys and the answer of

                    <h3>My Challenge</h3>
                    <p>In this project, I selected three unrelated podcast themes from the radio lab, and I designed
                        book covers as a trilogy. The hardest thing for me was understanding the concepts of each
                        podcast. After I presented my three designs for colors, the adapted design was unexpected for
                        me. I learned that having several different design ideas and flexibility is beneficial to become
                        a good&nbsp;designer.</p>

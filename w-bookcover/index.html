                    <p>In this exercise, I drew more than 100 sketches for each topic and created three designs based
                        on those sketches.
                        Once the design direction was selected, I created the remaining two designs, which were

                    <h3>Colors</h3>
                    <p>As for colors, I thought that we are not able to know the actual colors of things, and we can see
                        the colors only within the human color range. In that case, we do not know that strawberry’s
                        color is red or not. I thought about which color is the best color to suppress appetite and the
                        most unexpecting color and, I decided to use blue for the color. Also, I wanted to use different
                        materials for each design, and I used felt sheets made of recycled plastic bottles, watercolor
                        paintings, and&nbsp;gouache.</p>

                    <h3>Time</h3>
                    <p>The second topic was time, and I tried to represent the passage of time using the melted ice
                        cream. At the first book design, I used was strawberries, and I wanted to create a pop design
                        similar to the first design. It was hard to choose the background and text color to match the
                        ice cream’s color, and I spent a lot of time selecting the functional color as a part of
                        the&nbsp;trilogy. </p>

                    <h3>Choice</h3>
                    <p>The third topic was the choice. We continue to make the decision in everyday life and choose the
                        one from several selections. I represented many choices using a bunch of keys and the answer of
                        choice using a&nbsp;keyhole. </p>
